# GitHub Operations Prompts

This directory contains **optional operational prompts** for managing GitHub
using the AMP Operating Protocol.

These prompts apply AMP principles to *project hygiene and governance*,
not to application logic.

---

## What These Prompts Are

These prompts help with:

- Creating and maintaining a high-quality GitHub README
- Defining a consistent GitHub Projects workflow
- Migrating existing issues into an AMP-aligned structure
- Performing periodic project health checks

They are designed to:
- Reduce drift
- Make project state explicit
- Keep GitHub as the source of truth

---

## What These Prompts Are Not

These prompts are **not**:

- Required to use AMP
- Part of the core protocol
- Authoritative rules
- Application-specific logic

They are optional helpers.

---

## How to Use Them

- Run them intentionally, not automatically
- Treat outputs as proposals
- Review and edit results before applying changes
- Do not blindly overwrite existing project structure

These prompts follow the same discipline as the rest of AMP:
**humans decide, AI assists**.

---

## Relationship to AMP

These prompts demonstrate how AMP can be applied beyond code and documents,
extending into day-to-day project operations.

If they do not fit your workflow, you may safely ignore them.

---

## Summary

Use these prompts when:
- Setting up a new repository
- Cleaning up an existing one
- Periodically validating project health

Ignore them when they are unnecessary.

AMP remains fully functional either way.
