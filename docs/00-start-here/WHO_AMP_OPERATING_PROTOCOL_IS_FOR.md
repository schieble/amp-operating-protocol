# Who AMP Operating Protocol Is For (and Who It Is Not)

AMP Operating Protocol is intentionally opinionated.
This document clarifies who will benefit most from the AMP Operating Protocol and who may find it
misaligned with their goals or working style.

This is not a value judgment — it is about fit.

## The AMP Operating Protocol Is For You If

The AMP Operating Protocol is a good fit if you:

- Care about correctness, safety, and long-term maintainability
- Are willing to slow down early to avoid rework later
- Prefer explicit requirements over implied intent
- Want AI assistance without giving up control
- Are comfortable reviewing, editing, and rejecting AI output
- Value Pull Requests, tests, and review gates
- Want traceability from idea to implementation
- Are building or maintaining a real system (not a demo)

The AMP Operating Protocol works especially well for:
- Solo founders building production software
- Senior engineers and staff-level contributors
- Small teams with clear ownership
- Teams introducing AI into an existing disciplined workflow

---

## The AMP Operating Protocol Is Not For You If

The AMP Operating Protocol may feel heavy or restrictive if you:

- Want instant code without thinking through requirements
- Prefer speed over correctness at all costs
- Expect AI to infer missing requirements
- Dislike documentation or process entirely
- Want fully autonomous agents making decisions
- Are optimizing primarily for demos or throwaway prototypes

If your goal is maximum velocity with minimal structure,
the AMP Operating Protocol will likely feel frustrating.

That is intentional.

## Skill and Responsibility Assumptions

The AMP Operating Protocol assumes users can:

- Read and write basic Markdown
- Understand Git concepts such as branches and pull requests
- Evaluate tradeoffs and edge cases
- Decide when AI output is incorrect or incomplete
- Take responsibility for outcomes

The AMP Operating Protocol does **not** replace engineering judgment.
It amplifies it.

## How to Succeed With the AMP Operating Protocol

People who succeed with the AMP Operating Protocol tend to:

- Treat AI output as a proposal, not a verdict
- Keep changes small and reviewable
- Use clarifying questions as a feature, not friction
- Respect guardrails even under pressure
- Capture lessons learned explicitly

The AMP Operating Protocol rewards deliberate behavior.

## Final Note

If the AMP Operating Protocol feels slow, examine where ambiguity still exists.
If the AMP Operating Protocol feels effortless, double-check that discipline has not been bypassed.

AMP Operating Protocol is designed for people
who want AI leverage without losing accountability.
