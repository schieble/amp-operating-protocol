# Who AMP Operating Protocol Is For (and Who It Is Not)

AMP Operating Protocol is intentionally opinionated.
This document clarifies who will benefit most from AMP and who may find it
misaligned with their goals or working style.

This is not a value judgment — it is about fit.

## AMP Is For You If

AMP is a good fit if you:

- Care about correctness, safety, and long-term maintainability
- Are willing to slow down early to avoid rework later
- Prefer explicit requirements over implied intent
- Want AI assistance without giving up control
- Are comfortable reviewing, editing, and rejecting AI output
- Value Pull Requests, tests, and review gates
- Want traceability from idea to implementation
- Are building or maintaining a real system (not a demo)

AMP works especially well for:
- Solo founders building production software
- Senior engineers and staff-level contributors
- Small teams with clear ownership
- Teams introducing AI into an existing disciplined workflow

---

## AMP Is Not For You If

AMP may feel heavy or restrictive if you:

- Want instant code without thinking through requirements
- Prefer speed over correctness at all costs
- Expect AI to infer missing requirements
- Dislike documentation or process entirely
- Want fully autonomous agents making decisions
- Are optimizing primarily for demos or throwaway prototypes

If your goal is maximum velocity with minimal structure,
AMP will likely feel frustrating.

That is intentional.

## Skill and Responsibility Assumptions

AMP assumes users can:

- Read and write basic Markdown
- Understand Git concepts such as branches and pull requests
- Evaluate tradeoffs and edge cases
- Decide when AI output is incorrect or incomplete
- Take responsibility for outcomes

AMP does **not** replace engineering judgment.
It amplifies it.

---

## How to Succeed With AMP

People who succeed with AMP tend to:

- Treat AI output as a proposal, not a verdict
- Keep changes small and reviewable
- Use clarifying questions as a feature, not friction
- Respect guardrails even under pressure
- Capture lessons learned explicitly

AMP rewards deliberate behavior.

## Final Note

If AMP feels slow, examine where ambiguity still exists.
If AMP feels effortless, double-check that discipline has not been bypassed.

AMP Operating Protocol is designed for people
who want AI leverage without losing accountability.
