# Contributing to AMP Operating Protocol

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **AMP Operating Protocol**.

The AMP Operating Protocol is an operating protocol for disciplined human–AI collaboration in software
development. It is documentation- and process-first, not a code framework.

---

## Philosophy

The AMP Operating Protocol exists to help humans work *with* AI agents responsibly.

Good contributions:
- Increase clarity
- Preserve human accountability
- Reduce ambiguity
- Reflect real-world usage
- Avoid hidden automation

If a change makes the AMP Operating Protocol faster but less safe, it is unlikely to be accepted.

## What to Contribute

We welcome:
- Improvements to documentation clarity
- Refinements to rules or guardrails (with justification)
- New prompts that follow existing constraints
- Additional workflows based on real-world experience
- Lessons learned from production usage

We generally avoid:
- Tool-specific lock-in
- Implicit behavior or automation
- Opinionated mandates without context
- Features that assume autonomous AI behavior

---

## Tooling

The AMP Operating Protocol is **tool-agnostic**.

You may use:
- AMP
- Cursor
- GitHub Copilot
- Other AI-assisted editors or agents

As long as core AMP Operating Protocol principles are preserved:
- Clarifying questions before generation
- No invention of requirements
- Separation of intent and execution
- Human approval for high-impact actions

Some prompts may require light adaptation depending on tooling.
